# About the project

    This project simulates the game **Genius**, which is made up of a few buttons and is a challenge from Digital Innovation one.

# How does Genius Memory work?

    The game starts with a lit random button and at each round it will light up the button(s) that were previously lit in the same order they appeared and add another random button. In order for the player to advance through the levels of the game, he must click on the button(s) in the order in which they appear each round.
