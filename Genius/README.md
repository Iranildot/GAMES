# GENIUS

This project was developed through a challenge by **[Digital Innovation One (DIO)](https://www.dio.me/)**, some things were modified in the style of the page that contains the game and a panel was added that marks the rounds and the player's score, two **.html** files were also added, one for early game and one for late game. Minor changes were made to the script file.

# HOW TO USE IT?

The game starts with a lit random button and at each round it will light up the button(s) that were previously lit in the same order they appeared and add another random button. In order for the player to advance through the levels of the game, he must click on the button(s) in the order in which they appear each round.
